    "# Here's how it works:\n",
    "# Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "# Example: \"I love natural language processing\" → [\"I\", \"love\", \"natural\", \"language\", \"processing\"]\n",

    "# Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment of a piece of text by analyzing word frequencies associated with positive or negative sentiments.\n",
    "# Limitations\n",
    "# Loss of Context: Since the order of words is ignored, contextual or syntactic information is lost.\n",
